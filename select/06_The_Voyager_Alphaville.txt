Now, she's touched the earth, you feel her love
Pouring down like an endless rain
Of colors on your skin
She descends out of the blue,
A breathless victor of time
After more than a million light-years preparing her comeback
And she's rushing in
From the outside
On the crest of the seventh wave
She's the crown of creation
Creating you
The voyager
Is here to stay
The voyager
She's calling all stars
The voyager
She's riding a rainbow
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life
Watch out, you can't ignore what's going on
When your visions are drying out
Like the oceans from the underworld
Don't you know!
Before you turn to stone
You better head out for a royal trip
To the ivory city-side
And she's rushing in
From the outside
On the crest of the seventh wave
She's the crown of creation
Creating you
The voyager
Is here to stay
