[00:07.98] Down through the centuries the notion that life is rounded in a dream
[00:20.92] Has been a pervasive theme of philosophers and poets.
[00:21.92] So doesn't it make sense that death, too, would be wrapped in dream?
[00:23.18] That after death, your conscious life would continue,
[00:23.78] In what might be called a dream body?
[00:24.50] It would be the same dream body you experience in your everyday dream life,
[00:25.50] Except that in the post-mortal state - you could never again wake up.
[00:54.86] Never again return to your physical body.
