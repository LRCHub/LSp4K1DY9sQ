My oh my, the coast is never that clear
Hate them rocks and stones, quit throwing them here
Shut that door, the locust is coming inside
Get out them boots and walk that miracle mile
I'm a smooth operator
I'm a loose elevator
Watch me as I break the television
Talk me off the ledge, I can't envision
Take me to the hole to throw a wish in
I am on my way, unstoppable
Lock the doors and warn the federation
Bright and bold, here comes the revolution
My oh my, the king is on a mission
I am on my way, unstoppable
Pure at heart, a king infallible
Great big fucking time
So powerful, I
My oh my, a kiss inside of my ear
A cool clean fist to punch out the holiday cheer
Stop everyone, stop everyone coming inside
Watch out, this is the first time I'm feeling alive
I'm a smooth operator
I'm a loose elevator
I'm a smooth operator
I'm a loose elevator
Watch me as I break the television
Talk me off the ledge, I can't envision
Take me to the hole to throw a wish in
I am on my way, unstoppable
Lock the doors and warn the federation
Bright and bold, here comes the revolution
My oh my, the king is on a mission
I am on my way, unstoppable
Pure at heart, a king infallible
Great big fucking time
So powerful, I
