Now, she's touched the earth
You feel her love
Pouring down like an endless rain
Of colors on your skin

She descends out of the blue
A breathless victor of time
After more than a million light-years
Preparing her comeback

And she's rushing in from the outside
On the crest of the seventh wave
She's the crown of creation creating you

The voyager
Is here to stay
The voyager
She's calling all stars

The voyager
She's riding a rainbow
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life

The voyager
The voyager
The voyager
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life

Watch out
You can't ignore what's going on
When your visions are drying out
Like the oceans from the underworld
Oh, don't you know?

Before you turn to stone
You better head out for a royal trip
To the ivory city-side

And she's rushing in from the outside
On the crest of the seventh wave
She's the crown of creation creating you

The voyager
Is here to stay
The voyager
She's calling all stars

The voyager
She's riding a rainbow
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life

The voyager
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life

The voyager
The voyager
The voyager
The voyager
Gives you the kiss of life
